## New React docs and "You Might Not Need effects"

I love how the React team works. Their long reads are always full of insights not only about 
React but about programming in general. And know they got their hands on React's docs update.

Don't miss it. [New React docs](https://beta.reactjs.org). Now with detailed step-by-step 
tutorial and updated API reference.

If you vetted with React pay special attention to [Escape Natches](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/escape-hatches)
